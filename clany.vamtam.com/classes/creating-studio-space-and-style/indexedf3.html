SUMMARY:Creating Studio Space and Style
DESCRIPTION:\n	Event description\n	\n	Get some super stylish inspiration for making the most of small spaces. Whether you’re all about studio living in the city\, or have a small space in your home that could do with a refresh\, it’s amazing what a clever choice of paint color\, furnishings and decor can do to create a sense of space. \nIt’s easy to think of studio apartments as one big compromise. You can’t buy everything your heart desires\, let along fit it all into the space. But these apartments show that living in one room is enough – you can have everything you need\, and it can come in a stylish package with some carefully chosen decor and smart storage decisions. \n	By the end of this 3-month interactive live online course you will learn how to: \n◎ Use feature furniture\n◎ Try neutral colors with bold prints\n◎ Raise your bed\n◎ Storage in every square inch\n◎ Be clever with your corners\n◎ Double up your decor\n◎ Learn and apply good maintenance practices\n
