SUMMARY:Tiling Workshop
DESCRIPTION:\n	Event description\n	\n	Tiling can be especially tricky and prone to all sorts of DIY disasters so we invited a group of budding DIYers to our London HQ to learn some pro tricks! \n	◎ When drilling into tiles it’s essential to use a tile drill bit or your tiles will smash\, but if you’re drilling into tiles already on the wall\, you should use a dual tile and masonry bit\, allowing you to easily drill straight through both; \n	Guests got involved and had a go at everything\, some of the top tips they learned included: \n◎ To remove old tiles from a wall\, the easiest thing to do is to smash one from the centre and then work out from there\, carefully removing the other tiles in one piece;\n◎  It’s essential to use an adhesive comb when applying adhesive to tiles\, this creates air bubbles and allows them to bond to the wall without sliding off;\n◎ When drilling into tiles it’s essential to use a tile drill bit or your tiles will smash\, but if you’re drilling into tiles already on the wall\, you should use a dual tile and masonry bit\, allowing you to easily drill straight through both;\n
